# Maker-Blocks
INTIA is an interdisciplinary research project from germany. A large number of sub-elements have been and are being developed within the work.

In this reposetoriy you will find the code, the structure and partly models to recreate these elements.

All elements are currently working with the MQTT communication protocol and are linked internally via node-red. For this reason, we try to program as little intelligence as possible on the hardware elements.

If you have any questions, please contact intia[at]th-koeln.de.
